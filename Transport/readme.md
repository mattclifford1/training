## Week 2

 - people cluster: population cluster scales linearly with innovation, wealth and creativity.
 - evolution of transport: reinforcement of networks (original roads get bigger)

what zonal definition for modelling: MSOA good starting point (less coarse that ward - eg. Clifton).

Origin and Destination travelling for each zone.
- Origin number limited roughly by number of people that live in that zone.
- No clear trend for O vs D.
- O increases linearly (gradient of employment rate) with population of that zone
- more course zones for D reveales more single use areas for jobs.

Social Media data: can use eg twitter for location of where a tweets are posted for the same users as a journey.
 - smaller sample size
 - bias
 - live stream
 - uncontrolled
